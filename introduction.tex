\chapter{Introduction\label{cha:introduction}}
The introduction starts with an expansion of the first half of the abstract where you introduct context, stakeholder, and the topic.

In this domain and topic, what opportunities could there be?  (EngX Week 2, Chapter 3~\cite{ulrich2020product-design-development})

Based upon the most promising opportunity, explain how it might be VRIN. (EngX Week 2, Chapter 3~\cite{ulrich2020product-design-development})

Because you want to explore the VRIN opporunity, justify that it is worth doing with Real-Win-Worth it. (EngX Week 2, Chapter 3~\cite{ulrich2020product-design-development})

\section{Stakeholder}
What is the problem and who/what does it affect?
How much of an impact does this problem (or lack of a solution) have?
Tell us as much as you can about the stakeholder: (Week 2 in EngX, Chapter 5 in \cite{ulrich2020product-design-development}).
Are there other stakeholders who might also be affected?
Summarize the initial meeting with them and put details on the session into Appendix~\ref{sec:init-stak-meet}.
What did this group do on this topic before the project started?
Did some attempts suggest areas to explore?
\section{Background}
Provide background about the subject matter.
Think of this as a bit of a history lesson (e.g. How was morse code
developed?  How is it used today?.

This is a place where there are usually many citations.
It is suspicious when there is not.
If you have specifications or related standards, these must be
described and cited also.
As an example, you might cite the specific
RoboSub competition website (and documents) if working on the lighting system for an AUV\cite{guls2016auvlight}\index{AUV}

\section{Goals}
Write up the customer needs analysis here (Week 3 in EngX, Chapter 5 in~\cite{ulrich2020product-design-development}).
In the end, narrow it down to 7 or fewer needs\footnote{Fewer is easier!}. 
\begin{description}
  \item[\CN1]  Sort the fish
  \item[\CN2]
    Portion them quick
  \item[\CN3]  Not get stuck
\end{description}

Develop a high-level strategy of how you will solve the stakeholder's problem by looking for how the needs can be collected together:
Using Axiomatic Design theory, this is stated as a numbered list of Customer Needs(CN)~\cite{suh1990principles}.
The top level is \CN0.

Here is an example of a top level:

\begin{quote} \textbf{\CN0} A transfer bin for whole salmon, compatible with the SureTrack grader, cheaper and less prone to cracking due to skewing.  
The bin should be adaptable to a pure transfer task and be able to discharge anywhere along its path without
accidental discharge.~\cite{gerhard2016suretrack}
\end{quote}


Which latent needs seem more interesting to explore?

\section{Prior Art}
What is the current state of the art in this topic?
What are the products, tools, and/or techniques?
How do they compare particularly focusing on the customer needs?

\subsection{Cool System 1}
This system from Cool Company is able to do cool things:  BLah blah blah.
You can learn more about this particular product at CITATION.
\subsection{Cool System 2}
\subsection{Cool System 3}

Based upon this research, what are the critical metrics?
End this section with a competitive bench marking chart~\cite[p.104]{ulrich2020product-design-development})
What does the chart tell you about how you can do better or differentiate?

\section{Example Section}
\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{ru-logo}
  \caption[RU Logo]{Reykjav√≠k University Logo, used with permission.}\label{fig:ru-logo}
\end{figure}
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ll}\toprule
    $x$& $x^{2}$\\\midrule
    1 &1\\
    2 &4\\
    3 &9\\\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Table of squared numbers}\label{tab:numbers}
\end{table}
There is an RU logo in Figure~\ref{fig:ru-logo}.
This logo will scale according to the width of the text on the page.
There is a helpful list of squared numbers in Table~\ref{tab:numbers}.
This table is formatted in the style of a book, which is very differerent than the style one is used to in Excel.

\section{Data Management}
What data do you expect you need to collect electonically and how will you protect it following GDPR rules?  (EngX Week 3)
What regulations are relevant (cite them).
If the data is leaked, what will you do?
