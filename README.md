# report-template: Reykjavik University Engineering Report Template (for EngineeringX)
Important note: This is a fork of the RU School of Technology Ph.d, M.Sc., and B.Sc. templates from https://github.com/foleyj2/ru-thesis
It contains only a subset of the files from that template which have been modified to simplify evaluation as part of a course.
If you need to write your thesis or dissertation, use that template instead.

Please send pull requests and Issues for improvements/changes.
The official Reykjavík University Overleaf page is at https://www.overleaf.com/edu/reykjavik

## Overleaf
A regularly synchronized Overleaf template is found at XXXX
Be aware that unless you are a paying customer to Overleaf, your content can be seen by anyone who knows the URL.  This may be a problem if you are writing a document with sensitive information.
If you have requests or need a bug fixed, please open up a ticket in the "Issues" tab.

## References
One of LaTeX/Overleaf's big strengths is making sure citations and hyperreferences work.
### JabRef
The template author uses JabRef(https://www.jabref.org/) to manage his overleaf references.  The easiest way to keep this up to date is to use a git client to synchronize your reference (.bib) files locally to your computer, JabRef to update them with your new information, then use the git client to send those changes to Overleaf.

Overleaf's git feature is only available to paying accounts, so you will need to register a Reykjavík University email to your account in order to gain the benefits without paying for it yourself.  This can be done by adding a second email to your account and confirming it.

### Zotero
Zotero can be used to manage your references as well:  https://www.overleaf.com/blog/174-import-your-bibs-reference-management-tools-now-linked-to-overleaf-number-backtoschool#.WKLwrjuLRpg
